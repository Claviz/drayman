import BrowserWindow from "@site/src/components/BrowserWindow";

The smallest Drayman component code looks like this:

```tsx
export const component: DraymanComponent = async () => {
  return () => {
    return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
  };
};
```

It displays heading saying "Hello, world!":

<BrowserWindow>
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
</BrowserWindow>

In comparison to classic front-end frameworks, Drayman acts differently. Component data and methods are stored server-side. A user browser receives only JSON representation of what should be shown on a screen. This way a server-side code can be securely combined with UI code inside a single component script.

## Creating a component

Every component should be placed under `src/components` directory. In fact, if you have already installed Drayman using [Getting started guide](./getting-started.md), a "Hello, world!" component inside `home.tsx` file is already placed there:

```bash
my-app
└── src
   └── components
      └── home.tsx
```

Let's create a simple component which increases counter on button click. Add a new file to `src/components` directory called `counter.tsx`. Add this code:

```tsx title="src/components/counter.tsx"
export const component: DraymanComponent = async ({ forceUpdate }) => {
  let count = 0;

  return () => {
    return (
      <>
        <h3>{count}</h3>
        <button
          onclick={async () => {
            count++;
            await forceUpdate();
          }}
        >
          +1
        </button>
      </>
    );
  };
};
```

Now we need to show this component on a page. There are two ways of how to do it and they are described below.

## Using component in other component

As well as any HTML element, we can use created component from other components. Let's modify default `home.tsx` component:

```tsx title="src/components/home.tsx"
export const component: DraymanComponent = async () => {
  return () => {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        // highlight-next-line
        <counter />
      </>
    );
  };
};
```

We have added `<counter />` and now in addition to "Hello, world!" text, `home.tsx` displays our newly created counter component.

## Using component as web component

With Drayman, you can use created components anywhere on page. Any framework which allows web component usage, also can render Drayman component. This allows you to use server-side components in any environment.

If you have created a project using [Getting started guide](./getting-started.md), starting point of application is located inside `public/index.html`:

```html title="public/index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <title>Drayman Framework</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <!-- highlight-next-line -->
    <script src="/drayman-framework-client.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- highlight-next-line -->
    <drayman-element component="home"></drayman-element>

    <script>
      // highlight-next-line
      initializeDraymanFramework();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

As you can see:

1. A `drayman-framework-client.js` script is loaded inside header.
2. It is initialized inside body using `initializeDraymanFramework()` function.
3. Initial component `home.tsx` is loaded using special web component called `drayman-element`.

You can pass any component name (without extension) from `src/components` directory as an attribute. Let's do it for our `counter.tsx` component:

```html title="public/index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <title>Drayman Framework</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <script src="/drayman-framework-client.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <drayman-element component="home"></drayman-element>
    <!-- highlight-next-line -->
    <drayman-element component="counter"></drayman-element>

    <script>
      initializeDraymanFramework();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now in addtion to "Hello, world!" component, a counter component is rendered on page.
