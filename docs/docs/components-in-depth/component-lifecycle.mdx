To see how component is handled by Drayman, let's take for example, a component which reads data from selected file and shows it to user:

```tsx title="src/components/home.tsx"
import fs from "fs/promises";

export const component: DraymanComponent = async ({
  forceUpdate,
  ComponentInstance,
}) => {
  ComponentInstance.onDestroy = () => {
    console.log(`Component instance was destroyed!`);
  };

  const files = ["", ...(await fs.readdir("."))];
  let selectedFileContent: string;

  return async () => {
    return (
      <>
        <select
          onchange={async ({ value }) => {
            selectedFileContent = await fs.readFile(value, "utf-8");
            await forceUpdate();
          }}
        >
          {files.map((fileName) => (
            <option value={fileName}>{fileName}</option>
          ))}
        </select>
        <br />
        {selectedFileContent && <pre>{selectedFileContent}</pre>}
      </>
    );
  };
};
```

When user visits a page with this component here is what happens:

- A `module.execute` function gets called with [helper objects](./helpers/introduction) and returned function gets stored. Let's call this returned function a **render** function.
- A data returned by **render** function is what user actually sees on the page. This function, in turn, gets called each time a `forceUpdate` function gets called (you can read about `forceUpdate` in detail [here](./helpers/force-update)). To show initial result to user, `forceUpdate` is executed and user's browser receives instructions of what should be rendered on page.
- Next steps of component lifecycle are decided by user.
  - If user selects some option, an `onchange` event gets triggered on `select` element. In our component this event reads file contents and calls `forceUpdate` function. As described before, `forceUpdate` function calls **render** function behind the scenes and user receives a new representation of component.
  - If user decides to close a page with component or component disappears from DOM, `onDestroy` method of the [ComponentInstance](./helpers/the-component-instance-object) gets called printing `Component instance was destroyed!` message to the console and component instance with **render** function gets destroyed.
