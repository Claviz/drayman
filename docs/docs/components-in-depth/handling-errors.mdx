Drayman captures and pretty-prints with the stack trace all errors in your application from different sources: [events](./handling-events), [ComponentInstance methods](./helpers/the-component-instance-object) and even during [initialization and rendering](./component-lifecycle).

## Component rendering/UI errors

In some situations a component fails to render or initialize. Usually it would break the whole layout of the application, but Drayman catches such errors and displays problematic parts of the component.

Imagine having a component which always fails to initialize:

```tsx title="src/components/failure.tsx"
export const component: DraymanComponent = async () => {
  throw new Error("Oh, snap!");

  return async () => {
    return <h1>I have failed!</h1>;
  };
};
```

And other component which is always rendered successfully:

```tsx title="src/components/success.tsx"
export const component: DraymanComponent = async () => {
  return async () => {
    return <h1>I have succeeded!</h1>;
  };
};
```

These components are combined together inside a parent component:

```tsx title="src/components/home.tsx"
export const component: DraymanComponent = async ({ forceUpdate }) => {
  return () => {
    return (
      <div style={{ display: "flex", width: "100%", gap: "10px" }}>
        <div>
          <success />
        </div>
        <div>
          <failure />
        </div>
        <div>
          <success />
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  };
};
```

In result, whole application won't be broken and problematic component will be rendered with the descriptive error message.
