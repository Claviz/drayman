The `ComponentInstance` object can be used to check component instance ID or handle [lifecycle events](../component-lifecycle).

## ComponentInstance properties

### `id`

Unique ID of the current component instance. Can be used to differentiate connected users, for example, in chat.

## ComponentInstance methods

### `onDestroy()`

Override this function with your own and it will be executed when component instance gets destroyed.

```tsx title="src/components/home.tsx"
export const component: DraymanComponent = async ({ ComponentInstance }) => {

  //highlight-start
  ComponentInstance.onDestroy = () => {
    console.log(`Component instance was destroyed!`);
  };
  //highlight-end

  return () => {
    return <h3>Hello, world!</h3>;
};
```
