A `forceUpdate` is a function which calls a [render function](../component-lifecycle) and sends a result to the user.

This function is called when

- component gets initialized;
- `forceUpdate` is manually called inside a script.

Consider a component with button which on click increases a counter:

```tsx title="src/components/counter.tsx"
export const component: DraymanComponent = async ({ forceUpdate }) => {
  let count = 0;

  return () => {
    return (
      <>
        <h3>{count}</h3>
        <button
          onclick={async () => {
            count++;
            //highlight-next-line
            await forceUpdate();
          }}
        >
          +1
        </button>
      </>
    );
  };
};
```

User sees current value of counter because every time it increases, a `forceUpdate` function gets called.
